# pulse_disturbance
Response of age-structured populations to pulse disturbance

This code performs the analyses and creates the figures in White et al. "Pulse disturbances in age-structured populations: life history predicts initial impact and recovery time" (journal TBD)

The parent file is runme_pulse.m; it allows you to choose which of the ms figures to create and calls various helper files to do the analyses.
